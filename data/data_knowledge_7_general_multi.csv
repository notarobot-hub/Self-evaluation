In finance, the law of diminishing returns states that in a production process, increasing a single factor of production, while holding all other factors constant, will eventually result in smaller increases in output per unit of input [^1^][1]. This means that the marginal (incremental) output of the variable input will decrease as more units of it are added [^1^][1]. This law applies unless the technique of production also changes [^1^][1]. For example, if a factory employs workers to manufacture its products, at some point, the company will operate at an optimal level; with all other production factors constant, adding additional workers beyond this optimal level will result in less efficient operations [^2^][3]. This principle can help calculate profitable business decisions in the long or short run [^3^][4].

Classical music generally refers to the art music of the Western world, considered to be distinct from Western folk or popular music traditions. It is sometimes distinguished as Western classical music, as the term ""classical music"" also applies to non-Western art music [^1^][3]. Classical music is often characterized by formality and complexity in its musical form and harmonic organization, particularly with the use of polyphony [^1^][3]. The term ""classical"" most properly describes music composed from about 1750 to 1820, including the work of Haydn and Mozart, but only most of Beethoven. It doesn't include Bach or Wagner [^2^][4].

Quantum field theory (QFT) is a theoretical framework in physics that combines classical field theory, special relativity, and quantum mechanics [^1^][1]. It is used in particle physics to construct physical models of subatomic particles and in condensed matter physics to construct models of quasiparticles [^1^][1]. QFT treats particles as excited states of their underlying quantum fields, which are more fundamental than the particles [^1^][1]. Interactions between particles are described by interaction terms in the Lagrangian involving their corresponding quantum fields [^1^][1]. Two examples of modern quantum field theories are quantum electrodynamics, describing the interaction of electrically charged particles and the electromagnetic force, and quantum chromodynamics, representing the interactions of quarks and the strong force [^2^][2].
